#Redesigning my Blog

1. What is you site's primary purpose?
   My sites' main purpose is to present my blog posts, and to communicate my personality and design aesthetics. A secondary purpose is to allow readers to contact me.

2. Who is your target audience?
   My target audience is my fellow EDA students, tech geeks who are interested in design.

3. How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
   I want visitors to find it easy to navigate, to find and read the blogs. I'd also like them to feel like the site looks and functions like a professional site. I'd like them to feel like they know my personality a bit better after looking at the design.      

4. How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
   I'm going to use the 'F' design principal and put my most important content at the top/left of the page. My blog links and navigation will be two of the largest and most defined sections on the page to help the user find them easily. I'm also going to base my design off a professional web site that I admire to help me make it look good.
