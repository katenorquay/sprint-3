#Skeleton

Skeleton has a number of predefined colum widths that you can set with div classes. These columns width is defined with a percentage, for example a column that took up 6/12ths of the page would be defined as 50% rather than a fixed width. This means the columns will take up the same percentage of a page, no matter what size the screen is resized to. When the user resizes under 550px the columns stack on top of each other, and all become equal widths. This is because the screen size is too small to fit two or three columns on a page in a way that looks good. Probably the columns are defined at width: 100% and display: block, and then at the break point 550px they would change to a different width, and display: inline-block. This means the website will look good across all devices.
